                <p>
                  The targe is a late development of the cavalry shield, used
                  throughout the 15th century. In principle, it can be said that
                  the more complicated the shape, the later the dating of the
                  targe. It was typically made of lime wood, covered with
                  parchment, linen or a combination of both. The gesso (a
                  mixture of finely ground chalk and glue) was applied to the
                  coating to form a base for painting with tempera paints.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The targes, like other shields, were most often made by
                  specialist craftsmen called shieldmakers who were close to the
                  painters. In 1348, the painters and shieldmakers of cities of
                  Prague founded a brotherhood and added related craftsmen such
                  as glaziers, bookbinders, carvers, parchment makers,
                  goldsmiths, illuminators, cuprejtiers (zubreiter in German)
                  and others. Sometime after 1380, this fraternity split into
                  the Prague&apos;s Old Town Painters and Glaziers Guild and the
                  Prague&apos;s New Town Painters and Glaziers Guild, the
                  existence of which, however, is not securely established until
                  1455. In Prague&apos;s New Town, shieldmakers settled by the
                  walls, and in 1365 Charles IV granted them the privilege of
                  painting and selling shields and targes under the towers. This
                  privilege was renewed in 1380 and 1392. In 1458, it was
                  stipulated that the New Town shieldmakers should pay one
                  pavise a year, always after Christmas,{' '}
                  <i>
                    &quot;to the lords and the town for their need for their
                    honor and for their beauty&quot;
                  </i>
                  .

                <p>
                  A frequent motif on targets from the German area is a lady
                  holding a full coat of arms, i.e., a heraldic shield with
                  helmet, jewel, and coverts, as seen in the following examples
                  from the Metropolitan Museum of Art. In two cases the lady is
                  accompanied by a ribbon with a motto, but this has no heraldic
                  significance and is more of a pun.

                On the first target (Fig. 1) is painted a coat of arms belonging
                either to the Gottsmann family or to a relative of the Türriegel
                family, both from the Franks. The female figure on the side
                holds a banderole (scroll, ribbon) with a partially
                German-written motto: HAB MYCH ALS ICH BIN... (Take me as I
                am...). The decoration, with its vibrant colours on a silvery
                foil ground, is remarkably well preserved, having been hidden
                for centuries under layers of later paint. On the
                leather-covered back of the shield there are traces of the
                painted figure of Saint Christopher, whose image was meant to
                protect him from sudden death.

                Although the middle target (Fig. 2) is damaged by use and age,
                it is one of the most beautifully painted examples of a
                fifteenth-century targe. The surviving face depicts a woman in a
                feathered turban holding a banderole (scroll, ribbon) with the
                inscription in German &ldquo;FAHR MIT FREUDEN&rdquo; (go with
                joy). The heraldic shield on the right formerly bore the coat of
                arms of the owner, which is now illegible. The surrounding
                surfaces are finely painted with a decoration of scrolling
                leaves and &ldquo;cloud bands&rdquo; in opaque colours and
                translucent glazes on a polished silver-leaf ground.

                The surface of the third target (Fig. 3.) is painted with a fine
                silver decoration of coiled leaves (now darkened) on a black
                ground. During its working life, the shield was secondarily
                painted with two shields bearing the emblems of the Nuremberg
                patrician families of Ketzel (on a black ground a silver monkey
                holding a golden ball) and Igelbrecht (on a silver ground a
                black hedgehog with three golden apples on its back). These
                secondary coats of arms may have been added in the late 15th
                century by the Ketzel family in memory of Heinrich Ketzel the
                Elder (died 1438), burgess of Nuremberg in 1435-36, and his wife
                Anna Igelbrecht, who married him in 1391.

                <h4>Reconstruction</h4>
                <p>
                  Since we have not been able to find any surviving targe from
                  the Czech territory, I chose for reconstruction the following
                  targe from 1440 - 1460, probably from Nuremberg, which is now
                  in the Philadelphia Museum of Art. As we know, Bohemia had a
                  strong trade relationship with Nuremberg, and Jošt himself
                  owned firearms made in Nuremberg. A targe with similarly
                  stylized scroll-like edges is depicted by Jan van Eyck in his
                  painting &ldquo;The Knights of Christ&rdquo;, which is part of
                  the left panel of the Ghent Altarpiece of 1432. The shield was
                  first repainted around 1500 and its current appearance is the
                  result of a 17th-century Baroque repainting, when it was
                  painted for funerary purposes and bearing the coats of arms of
                  the Nuremberg patrician families Haller and Imhof. The
                  original shield is 55.6 cm high, 52 cm wide and has a bend of
                  23 cm. It weighs 2880 grams.

                  Since the original painting of the target has not survived, we
                  decided to create an original but period-appropriate motif for
                  it. The background of the shield is black, with a decoration
                  of silver scrolled leaves, as on the German shield from fig.
                  3. St. Dorothy from the left wing of the altar from Jeníkov,
                  dated to 1460, was chosen as the model for the lady. The coat
                  of arms she holds on the shield is based on the oldest known
                  depiction of the Týřovský coat of arms from the tombstone of
                  the church in Jince. The armorial figures are stylized
                  according to the Book of Arms (Wappenbuch), which was created
                  and donated to Emperor Frederick III by the patrician Konrad
                  Grünenberg of Konstanz in 1483. The heraldic shield, divided
                  into quarters, shows a black imperial eagle (i.e. with two
                  heads) with golden armour (talons and beak) on a silver
                  background in the 1st and 4th fields, while in the 2nd and 3rd
                  fields there are three white quills joined together by spikes
                  on a blue field. The left leaning shield is surmounted above
                  the right corner by a helmet, the same as that on the target
                  in Fig. 1, and bearing, in addition to the jewel and red
                  coverts with silver lining, also a gold crown. In the jewel is
                  a red Tartar hat with silver lining and black lips. The
                  banderole with the inscription{' '}
                  <i>&ldquo;Pomny na mye ma myla vyerna pany&rdquo;</i>{' '}
                  (Remember me my dear faithful lady), which is taken from a
                  contemporary spur, is placed in the same way as on the tarche
                  of Fig. 2. On the inner side is an inartistic painting of St.
                  Christopher.

                  Richter.
